# Web-Application-Penetration-Testing-
This project aims to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test (VAPT) on a  deliberately insecure web application – Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). The testing  methodology is guided by the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, the industry standard for identifying  and mitigating web application security flaws. 

# 🛡️ Web Application Penetration Testing Report – DVWA (Project 2)

This repository contains a PDF report documenting a **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test (VAPT)** performed on the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**, aligned with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
